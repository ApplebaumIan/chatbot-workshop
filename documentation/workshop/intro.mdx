# Introduction 🤖 💬

This workshop will introduce you to the importance of strong prompt engineering. By integrating AI chatbots into a Discord classroom, you will learn how to set up, alter, and refine chatbot behaviors through effective prompts, while also contending with an intentional “distractor” or adversary designed to test their chatbot’s resilience. By the end of this workshop, you will understand how to craft robust prompts that guide chatbot behavior consistently, even in the face of conflicting or adversarial inputs.
